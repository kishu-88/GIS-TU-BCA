## Definition

**Geographic Information System (GIS)** is a computer-based tool that allows users to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and visualize spatial or geographical data.

It integrates **hardware, software**, and **data** for capturing and managing spatially referenced information.

Geographical information system (GIS) is basically defined as a systematic integration of hardware and software for capturing, storing, displaying, updating manipulating and analyzing spatial data.

Map making and geographic analysis are not new, but a GIS performs these tasks better and faster than the old manual methods. And, before GIS technology, only a few people had the skills necessary to use geographic information to help with decision making and problem solving.

## Functions of GIS

    - GIS allows users to input geographic data from various sources like maps, satellite images, GPS, and field surveys.
    
- **Data Storage and Management**: 
    - GIS organizes spatial data in a structured way using databases, making it easy to retrieve and update when necessary.
    
- **Data Manipulation**: 
    - Users can modify and process data to suit different analysis needs. This includes tasks like digitization, editing, and transforming data projections.
    
- **Data Analysis**: 
    - GIS provides tools for spatial analysis, including buffering, overlaying, and proximity analysis, helping users derive meaningful insights from raw geographic data.
      
- **Data Visualization**: 
    - GIS enables the creation of visual representations of data through maps, charts, and 3D models, making the data more understandable and actionable.
## Applications of GIS:

    - GIS helps city planners in managing urban areas by providing tools for mapping land use, infrastructure, and population density.
2. **Environmental Management**:
    
    - GIS is used for tracking environmental changes, mapping ecosystems, and managing resources like water, forests, and wildlife.
3. **Disaster Management**:
    
    - GIS aids in disaster risk assessment, emergency response planning, and post-disaster recovery by providing real-time spatial data on affected areas.
4. **Transportation and Logistics**:
    
    - GIS helps in route planning, traffic management, and optimizing transportation networks by providing accurate geographic information.
5. **Agriculture**:
    
    - In precision farming, GIS is used to monitor soil conditions, manage crops, and optimize irrigation systems for better yields.
6. **Health and Epidemiology**:
    
    - GIS can track disease outbreaks, analyze health service distribution, and assist in public health management by mapping health-related data.

## Nature and Sources of data
#### 1. Nature of GIS

GIS data can be broadly categorized into two types: **spatial data** and **attribute (non-spatial) data**.
##### **a. Spatial Data**:

- **Spatial data** refers to information about the location and shape of geographic features. It describes the physical space and how objects are positioned within it.
- **Spatial data types** include:
    - **Point data**: Represents discrete locations (e.g., schools, fire hydrants).
    - **Line data**: Represents linear features (e.g., roads, rivers).
    - **Polygon data**: Represents areas (e.g., lakes, land parcels).

Spatial data is often stored in vector or raster formats:

- **Vector data**: Uses points, lines, and polygons to represent geographic features. It is highly precise and is often used for discrete objects like roads, boundaries, and buildings.
- **Raster data**: Uses a grid of cells (pixels) to represent geographic features. Each cell has a value representing a characteristic of that location (e.g., elevation, temperature). Raster data is often used for continuous phenomena like elevation or land cover.

##### **b. Attribute (Non-Spatial) Data**:

- **Attribute data** provides descriptive information about spatial features. It is non-spatial and explains the characteristics or qualities of geographic objects.
- For example, a point representing a school can have attributes like its name, number of students, and school type.
- Attribute data is stored in tables and linked to spatial data through unique identifiers.
